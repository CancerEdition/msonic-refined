# Mania Sonic, Refined!

A Sonic Mania mod, redrawing various frames and bodyparts of Sonic's spriteset for consistency and quality.

### The goal of this mod is "redraft, not replace."

You may have seen several Sonic Mania mods attempting to replace the whole of Sonic's spriteset with assets from other Sonic games or original assets tailored to the author's individual style or personal fixings.

To contrast, this mod intends to break down Sonic Mania's artstyle and how it treats Sonic for the purposes of cleaning up mistakes, such as questionable anatomy, without inventing a new identity.

## Isn't this redundant with CE+ Sonic?

CE+ Sonic would be considered a "personal fixings" kind of mod. It does not specifically target "mistakes".

A lot of CE+ Sonic's edits moreso have to do with changing Mania's visual identity to something more akin to recent portrayals of Classic Sonic in 3D, such as a more muted tone of blue, visible shoe buckles, and spines that flow directly off of the sides of Sonic's head. 

Additionally, lot of examples of poor spriting technique from base Mania, such as the wild inconsistency of Sonic's turntable "barrel" animation, are left unchanged.

To contrast, Mania Sonic Refined intends to study Mania Sonic and his predeccessors in order to preserve their artistic intent while redrawing such mistakes to form a more cohesive spriteset.

Hence, this is what makes this mod separate from CE+ Sonic.

However, other features from CE+ Sonic, such as additional animations, mod compatibility, and configurable palettes, may be considered in the future.
