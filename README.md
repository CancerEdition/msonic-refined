A Sonic Mania mod, redrawing various frames and bodyparts of Sonic's spriteset for consistency and quality.

The goal of this mod is "redraft, not replace."

You may have seen several Sonic Mania mods attempting to replace the whole of Sonic's spriteset with assets from other Sonic games or original assets tailored to the author's individual style.

To contrast, this mod intends to break down Sonic Mania's artstyle and how it treats Sonic for the purposes of cleaning up mistakes, such as questionable anatomy, without inventing a new identity.
